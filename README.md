## Problem Statement :
Evolution of a creator economy or passion economy has been led by media platforms such as YouTube and Instagram. Earlier, these creators used to just depend on advertising but now there are a lot more streams of monetization available through subscription services, merchandise sales, donations, among other models, and earn more from an existing user base on an ongoing basis.Creators face a major problem of managing deals & projects, accepting & managing payments, manage invoices, accept tips from fans, and many more . 


## Our Solution : 
An easy to use interface which not only helps the content creator to view its performance but also can accommodate all the necessary information required like invoices, received payments and many more can be viewed in a single web app. 

Instead of rendering and pondering at 4 different places the creator can find all the 4 things at the same time on the dashboard which includes : 
-  My Projects
-  Analysis 
-  Collaborate/Invoices/Bills 
-  Fundraiser

### 1. My Projects : 
In this section we have 2 sub-features which includes :<br>
a)  Ongoing projects in which he can track down his completion of work like creating new content, its marketing, etc once those tasks are completed it contains a checkbox so he can keep track of those projects. <br>
b)  Future projects or upcoming projects include a schedule where he can note down all the future events and a reminder is set through the calendar to keep him updated.

### 2. Analysis : 
Here one can see numerous graphs which all represent various categories for example :The progress of the creator on instagram, facebook and twitter. Also detailed information about its statistics about increase in engagement of the creator from last year to react times. The increased number of followers, likes and so on. This data is collected by the web scraping method. Which helps the creator where he should work on to increase its reach. 
 
### 3. Collaborate/Invoices/Bills : 
Here the creator can generate invoices of the upcoming as well as the past events in which he collaborated  with other brands or content creators also this gives a rough idea of how the deal would cost him. Once all the details are filled on clicking save it renders on a new page from where he/she can download the pdf of the invoice and keep handy to himself for future reference.


### 4. Fundraiser : 
This domain includes feature where if the content creator is starting a fundraiser for flood relief or for any other good cause he creates a form and includes all the details regarding the same and a form is created which is a payment gateway option where viewers can contribute according to their capacity the name stays anonymous but to keep a track of the fund raised you can login into the razorpay account to check the total amount generated.

## Future Scope : 
For future scope we will be making a notification feature which will be linked to all social media handles and also the payment gateway transaction messages would be notified once the transaction is complete. Also a compare feature we would like to implement where the creator can search and analyze graphically his performance as well as other content creators.
